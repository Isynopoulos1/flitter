# The prototype: Flitter

As the final project of the **Glovo and Keepcoding** Bootcamp **"Women in Tech"**, we have developed a platform that allows the publication of mini-contents,
in a public or private way.

The objective of this project has been to put into practice everything learned during the bootcamp, simulating a real situation: development of a project using iterations, making architectural decisions with a deadline for delivery.

This repository provides a backend API that interacts with a user interface that you will also find visiting https://github.com/tellale/flitter-frontend
